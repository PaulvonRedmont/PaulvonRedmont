Here are some projects I've worked on (although most of my more impressive and useful work is closed source): 

Redmont Client (RL-Powered ML bot for Amazon Alexa's Knight Manager): https://github.com/PaulvonRedmont/Redmont-Client
Automatic MLA-Formatter ï¼ˆit does exactly what you think it does): https://github.com/PaulvonRedmont/Automatic-MLA-Formatter
Evernote Tag Renaming Macro (allows users to batch rename their tags on Evernote, as this is not built in to the software): https://github.com/PaulvonRedmont/Evernote-Tag-Renaming-Macro

Discord Counting Bots (simple scripts that allows users to bot counting in a counting channel): https://github.com/PaulvonRedmont/Auto-Counter-for-Discord-Server
